title: "Portfolio - Amirath Souhouin "
description: "About Me: I am a computer engineering graduate with a deep passion for the art of making. Driven by curiosity and a love for engineering, I am constantly exploring the process of bringing ideas to life—from programming and electronics to designing mechanical structures. My portfolio is a journey through my self-driven projects, where I take on challenges, experiment boldly, and expand my skills across all facets of engineering.

My Approach: In every project, I dive into both the technical and creative aspects, merging software, hardware, and structural design. As I learn, I’m not afraid to take risks and tackle new concepts hands-on, showcasing each project as a step forward in my path as a maker. Through my portfolio, I aim to share the excitement of the entire "making" journey and inspire others to explore the endless possibilities in engineering."
